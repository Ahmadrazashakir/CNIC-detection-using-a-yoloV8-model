# Alexnet and VGG 
These are few notebooks that contained the code of a basic neural network and were assigned to transform that network into Alexnet or VGG according to structure explained in their datasheet or architecture.
Then the model was run and used to predict classes of a few pictures which they successfully did.
Results are probably in the parent folder.
